This project was developed to classify heart disease in patients across multiple locations. Such locations consist of: 
Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Virginia. This data was imputed using k-nearest neighbors as much of the data
was missing. Given this, the testing accuracy achieved in the model was 86.2%. The model created was an Artifical
Neural Network (ANN/MLP). The creation of such model was done with the help of Neural Networks from Scratch by
Harrison Kinsley and Daniel Kukiela. The model consisted of two hidden (or dense) layers. The first activation
function used was ReLU, and the second was Sigmoid. The loss function chosen was Binary Cross Entropy, and
regularization techniques used were Dropout and L2 (ridge) regularization.
